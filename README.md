# dndRandoGen
DnD Random Character Generator for Code Louisville C# capstone project.

This program will put together a random character comprised of a randomly selected
class, a randomly selected race, and a randomly selected gender. (Will eventually add in stat info and sub-class info).
The program will start out welcoming the user to the experience. After they choose which option they want to do, the program will take the user to the character menu, where it will show the randomly generated character at the top with options to change the character, save it, or go to previous menu.

Requirements Met:
- Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
- Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
