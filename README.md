# dndRandoGen
DnD Random Character Generator for Code Louisville C# capstone project.

This program will put together a random character comprised of a randomly selected
class and a randomly selected race. (Will eventually add in stat info and sub-class info).
The program will start out welcoming the user to the experience and asking the name they wish to 
call their character. After they are done with their input, the program will take the name and
assign it a random race and random class, and will thank the user for using the service. It
will have an option to run the program again, and an option to quit the program.
